Summary:
This paper addresses a design pattern widely used in network system which states that placing the logic or functionality at the application level is most often the best approach in system design. 

Strength:
1. The paper provides plenty of illustrations that this design principle is applied in various situations in network system, which is quite convicing.
2. The paper analysis the details of this pattern in both functional and performance perspective which makes it convicing.
3. The paper also mentions applications of this principle in other systems as well which gives the reader a more complete view of the topic.

Weakness:
1. This paper is more narrative than reasoning, lacking graphs or equations which would make it more like a technical writing and more convincing.
2. The paper does not mention how should the FIFO message delivery be guranteed from application level.
3. The paper lacks quantitave analysis or convicing data when it comes to the performance issue.
